        <h2>Lighting control via an Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>                    
        <p> refers to the use of connected devices and sensors to automate and manage the lighting in a home, office, or other space. An IoT platform is a software application or system that enables the remote control and monitoring of connected devices, typically through a web browser or mobile app.
        With lighting control via an IoT platform, users can set schedules for their lights, dim or brighten them, and turn them on or off remotely. They can also set up rules or triggers for their lighting, such as turning on the lights when motion is detected or when the sun sets.

        IoT-based lighting control systems can help to save energy by turning off lights when they are not needed and by adjusting the brightness to match the ambient light in the room. They can also provide convenience and added security by allowing users to control their lights remotely or by setting them to turn on and off when away from home.</p>
